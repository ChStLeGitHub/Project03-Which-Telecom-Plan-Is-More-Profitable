# Which Telecom Plan Is More Profitable?
 
**Objective:** To conduct a preliminary analysis as well as hypothesis testing for the phone and internet provider Megaline using five datasets of client behavior to determine whether the Surf or the Ultimate prepaid plan generates more revenue.

**Accomplishment:** I concluded that Megaline's commercial department should focus on the Ultimate plan, as it generates an average of $72.38 per user per month, compared to $61.43 per user per month for the Surf plan. Conducting a two-tailed t-test (with a 95% confidence interval) confirmed this difference to be statistically significant, suggesting that the Ultimate plan is more profitable.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation
